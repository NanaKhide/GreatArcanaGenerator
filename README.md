# GreatArcanaGenerator
This Repo contains a quick python script i wrote and a json file.

The json lists only the Grat Arcana for now and follows this structure:
Json File -> Great Arcana -> Name -> Upright / Reversed

The python code should be commented sufficiently but in case something is unclear please open an issue on this page.

Disclaimer: I will not guide you through how to setup python on your machine. 
There are way better guides and Tutorials out there that you can follow.
